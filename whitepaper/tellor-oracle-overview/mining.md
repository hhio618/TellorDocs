# Mining

Data submission is done through a competitive process where miners respond to PoW challenges and the winners get to submit data to Tellor’s on-chain data feed. PoW provides an excellent source of sybil resistant randomness to Tellor’s smart contracts as well as provides an ideal system for token distribution.

## Staking

Miners have to stake 500 Tributes to be able to mine. Staking allows for economic penalties to miners submitting incorrect values. If a miner wants to withdraw his stake, he can request a withdrawal at any point. The miner’s tokens are then locked for 7 days in order to wait for potential disputes, at which point he can unlock his tokens for transfer.

## Hash Function

Tellor uses a custom hash function based upon available functions in solidity. In order to mine a block, the miners must produce a nonce solving the following equation:

`sha256(ripemd160(keccak256(challenge, msg.sender, nonce))) % difficulty = 0`

## Becoming a Miner

Mining on Tellor is very competitive. For more information on becoming a miner, please see our documentation: [https://tellor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MinerSetup/](https://tellor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MinerSetup/)
