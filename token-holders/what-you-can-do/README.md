# What you can do

Tellor is more than just an oracle protocol. It's a permissionless community and together we cryptographically secure the process of bringing real-world data on-chain. As a token holder of TRB you can participate in a few ways.

* You can start the process to invalidate bad data by disputing values that are submitted by the mining network.
* Once a dispute is started, all TRB holders can vote on the validity of the data.
* You can request data updates by adding tips to the value type of your choice
