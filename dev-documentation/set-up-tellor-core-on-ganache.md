# Set up Tellor Core on Ganache

## Overview

In order to run Tellor Core locally, you will need to: 1. Run a Ethereum blockchain using Ganache 2. Deploy the Tellor Core smart contracts using Truffle Suite 3. Make a Data Request 3. Run 5 Staked Tellor Miners and 1 Data Server The instructions below are provided details for each of these steps.

### Step 0: Install Operating System Dependancies <a id="step-0-install-operating-system-dependancies"></a>

You'll need to install:

* Ganache
* Truffle
* Node
* Node Package Manager \(npm\)
* Go

### Step 1: Run an Ethereum blockchain using Ganache <a id="step-1-run-an-ethereum-blockchain-using-ganache"></a>

Start in a terminal using the following command:

```text
ganache-cli -m "nick lucian brenda kevin sam fiscal patch fly damp ocean produce wish"
```

If started correctly, you should see the following Available Accounts are the same as those listed below:

```text

```

#### About the 12-word Seed Phrase \(Mnemonic\) Used By Ganache <a id="about-the-12-word-seed-phrase-mnemonic-used-by-ganache"></a>

The mnemonic used here will properly generate addresses that conform with the 6 hard-coded initial staked miners used to bootstrap Tellor. You can view these addresses in the source code here in the [TellorStake init method](https://github.com/tellor-io/TellorCore/blob/23098d4cc0c717d9d121e26d24e0723db4914f34/contracts/libraries/TellorStake.sol#L24).

**If you choose to edit the mnemonic**, you will need to change the TellorCore source code. A note is included in the next step about how to do this. Since this is a local deployment of TellorCore, you can use this nnemonic to make things easier and avoid changing the TellorCore code. **Do not use this seed phrase on mainnet**.

#### About using Ganache GUI <a id="about-using-ganache-gui"></a>

You may use the Ganache GUI but you must start a new workspace using the mnemonic or you will need to change the staked miner address in the TellorCore code based on the note above.

To set the mnemonic in the Ganache GUI, start by clicking **New Workspace** the go under **Accounts & Keys** and _Enter the Mnemonic you wish to use_ before Saving and starting the workspace.

### Step 2: Deploy the TellorCore Smart Contract Using Truffle <a id="step-2-deploy-the-tellorcore-smart-contract-using-truffle"></a>

In another terminal, clone the TellorCore repository:

```text
git clone https://github.com/tellor-io/TellorCore.git
```

After cloning the contract, change director into the contract and install the Node packages:

```text
cd TellorCore
npm install
```

Make a `.env` file. Even though we don't need any environment variables, this will prevent unwanted messages later:

```text
touch .env
```

Next, compile the smart contracts:

```text
truffle compile
```

The complilation is successful if you receive a message like:

```text
> Artifacts written to /path/to/TellorCore/build/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - solc: XXXXX
```

and depending on your version of Solidity, you may see _warnings_ but these are OK as they are not errors.

After the compilation has run successfully, migrate the smart contracts to deploy them to the local Ethereum blockchain set up in Step 1.

```text
truffle migrate
```

The migration \(deployment\) is successful if you receive a message like:

```text
Summary
=======
> Total deployments:   17
> Final cost:          0.5289897 ETH
```

#### Finding the Tellor Contract Address <a id="finding-the-tellor-contract-address"></a>

You will need to review the output of the `truffle migrate` step and save the **TellorMaster contract address** for later use. You can find this by looking for the following in the output of the `migrate` step:

```text
Deploying 'TellorMaster'
------------------------
> transaction hash:    0x72ba3d8c299ad5bb6d31358bb7587c531d6639a3e55045d90f0bd5a6133c89fb
> Blocks: 0            Seconds: 0
> contract address:    0x7DdC408C0Cd13D3543156AE2bc5772C56E91AA0f
```

:star: The contract address above will be `0x7DdC408C0Cd13D3543156AE2bc5772C56E91AA0f` and you will need this when setting up the 5 staked miners in the next step. Your contract address may be different.

#### Understanding Initial Stake Miners <a id="understanding-initial-stake-miners"></a>

At this point, the Tellor Core smart contracts have been deployed to the Ethereum blockchain you are running locally with Ganache. As part of the deployment, 6 addresses were given 1000 Tellor Tributes \(TRB\). This is done to bootstrap the Tellor mining process. Although only 5 miners are required for mining, a 6th stake was minted and used for handling disputes that would arise from submitting bad data to the Tellor Oracle.

### Step 3: Making a Data Request <a id="step-3-making-a-data-request"></a>

Once the contract is started and before you start the stake miners, make a request so that the miners have something to work on when they start up. This can be done from the Truffle console:

```text
truffle console
```

Then in the console, run the commands:

```text
let oracle = await TellorMaster.deployed()
let oracleAddress = (web3.utils.toChecksumAddress(oracle.address))
let oracle2 = await new web3.eth.Contract(Tellor.abi, oracleAddress)
await web3.eth.sendTransaction({to: oracleAddress, from: accounts[0], gas: 4000000, data: oracle2.methods.requestData("GLD","GLD/USD",1000,0).encodeABI()})
```

This will create a transaction that requests data from the Tellor oracles and will ensure the miner have something to work on when you move to the next step.

You can use this code later to make additional requests. The configuration of the miners in Step 4 will have them automatically make requests so you don't need to keep running this command.

### Step 4: Run 5 Staked Tellor Miners and 1 Data Server <a id="step-4-run-5-staked-tellor-miners-and-1-data-server"></a>

#### Tellor Mining Overview <a id="tellor-mining-overview"></a>

In this step, you will need to run each of the 5 miners and the 1 data server in seperate terminals. These 5 miners will start the mining process and the 1 data server will be how each of the 5 miners fetch data from the internet. The network topology of this setup is as follow:

```text
           <-> Miner (0xE037) <->
           <-> Miner (0xcdd8) <->
Tellor     <-> Miner (0xb9dD) <-> Data Server <-> Internet
(on chain) <-> Miner (0x2305) <->
           <-> Miner (0x3233) <->
```

The data server pulls data from the internet, the 5 staked miners pull data from the data server and submit on-chain to the Tellor Core smart contracts. The following instructions cover setting this up locally.

#### Build TellorMiner from Source <a id="build-tellorminer-from-source"></a>

Start by cloning the TellorMiner repository:

```text
git clone https://github.com/tellor-io/TellorMiner.git
```

Now change directories and build the Tellor Miner executable:

```text
cd TellorMiner
go run ./pow/generate_opencl.go
mv kernelSource.go pow/
go build
```

At this point, you will have the `./TellorMiner` executable and you can move on to creating the configuration files.

#### Configure the 5 Tellor Miners <a id="configure-the-5-tellor-miners"></a>

Next, create a copy of the configuration file for the first staked miner:

```text
cp config.json config1.json
```

Edit `config1.json` to include the following:

```text
{
    "contractAddress": "0x7DdC408C0Cd13D3543156AE2bc5772C56E91AA0f",
    "nodeURL": "http://localhost:8545",
    "databaseURL":"http://localhost7545",
    "publicAddress": "0xE037EC8EC9ec423826750853899394dE7F024fee",
    "privateKey": "4bdc16637633fa4b4854670fbb83fa254756798009f52a1d3add27fb5f5a8e16",
    "serverWhitelist": [
                "0xE037EC8EC9ec423826750853899394dE7F024fee",
                "0xcdd8FA31AF8475574B8909F135d510579a8087d3",
                "0xb9dD5AfD86547Df817DA2d0Fb89334A6F8eDd891",
                "0x230570cD052f40E14C14a81038c6f3aa685d712B",
                "0x3233afA02644CCd048587F8ba6e99b3C00A34DcC"
    ],
    "serverHost": "localhost",
    "serverPort": 5000,
    "ethClientTimeout": 3000,
    "trackerCycle": 10,
    "requestData":1,
    "gasMultiplier": 1,
    "gasMax":10,
    "gpuConfig":{
      "default":{
        "disabled": true
      }
    },
    "trackers": [
          "balance",
          "currentVariables",
          "disputeStatus",
          "gas",
          "top50",
          "tributeBalance",
          "indexers"
    ],
    "dbFile": "./tellorDB"
}
```

After saving this config1.json file. Create 4 copies of this file and edit the `dbFile`, `publicAddress`, `privateKey` for each of the files to incldue the other 5 staked miner addresses \(the command below do this for you with `cp` and `sed`\):

```text
cp config1.json config2.json
sed -i -e 's/tellorDB/tellorDB2/' config2.json
sed -i -e '1,/0xE037EC8EC9ec423826750853899394dE7F024fee/ s/0xE037EC8EC9ec423826750853899394dE7F024fee/0xcdd8FA31AF8475574B8909F135d510579a8087d3/' config2.json

```

Finaly, make 1 more copy of the config for the data server and update the `serverHost` address to `0.0.0.0`:

```text
cp config1.json config-dataserver.json
sed -i -e 's/\"serverHost\": \"localhost\"/\"serverHost\": \"0.0.0.0\"/' config-dataserver.json
```

The stakes have already been deposited for these Addresses so you can now move on to strating up each of the miners.

#### Starting the Miners and Data Server <a id="starting-the-miners-and-data-server"></a>

You can do this in 6 separate terminals locally. Run each of the command in each of the terminals and confirm they start up correctly.

| Terminal \# | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | ./TellorMiner --config=config-dataserver.json dataserver | Data Server |
| 2 | ./TellorMiner --config=config1.json mine -r | Staked Miner 1 |
| 3 | ./TellorMiner --config=config2.json mine -r | Staked Miner 2 |
| 4 | ./TellorMiner --config=config3.json mine -r | Staked Miner 3 |
| 5 | ./TellorMiner --config=config4.json mine -r | Staked Miner 4 |
| 6 | ./TellorMiner --config=config5.json mine -r | Staked Miner 5 |

## Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

At this point, you will have 7 terminals running: 6 terminals for the TellorMiner and 1 terminal for running Ganache. You should see your miners are submitting transactions and if you want to check that the network difficulty is rising, you can used Truffle's console again and run the following commands:

```text
let difficulty = await oracle.getUintVar("0xb12aff7664b16cb99339be399b863feecd64d14817be7e1f042f97e3f358e64e")
difficulty.toNumber()
```

#### DISCLAIMER <a id="disclaimer"></a>

```text
Mine at your own risk.

Mining requires you deposit 500 Tellor Tributes.  These are a security deposity.  If you are a malicious actor (aka submit a bad value), the community can vote to slash your 500 tokens.

Mining also requires submitting on-chain transactions on Ethereum.  These transactions cost gas (ETH) and can sometimes be signifiant if the cost of gas on EThereum is high (i.e. the network is clogged).  Please reach out to the community to find the best tips for keeping gas costs under control or at least being aware of the costs.

If you are building a competing client, please contact us.  A lot of the miner specifications are off-chain and a significant portion of the mining process hinges on the consensus of the Tellor community to determine what proper values are.  Competing clients that change different pieces run the risk of being disputed by the commmunity.

There is no guaruntee of profit from mining.

There is no promise that Tellor Tributes currently hold or will ever hold any value.
```
