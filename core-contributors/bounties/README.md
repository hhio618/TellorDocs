# Bounties

**The Tellor Bounties program** is a way to reward developers who help us build out Tellor and is funded from a portion of Tellor's dev-share. As a decentralized protocol with no admin key, it's important that Tellor grows more and more community driven. A robust community of contributors makes us stronger. This is the reason our motto is **We Are Tellor**.

If you'd like to contribute to Tellor by taking on one of more of these bounties please email **info@tellor.io** about it. Please include the word Bounties in the subject line.

You can also DM **@the\_fett** directly via Telegram.
